      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <div className="story-content">
        <p>
          I've spent over <span className="highlight">20 years</span> in tech,
          but my perspective on quality comes from somewhere deeper, the
          healthcare frontlines. That experience taught me that quality isn't
          just about clean code or passing tests. It's about{" "}
          <span className="highlight">real impact on real people</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey started as a{" "}
          <span className="highlight">Software Engineer</span>, building complex
          systems for the insurance industry. I wrote Java applications that
          moved critical data between state departments. I traveled to
          implementation sites. I trained users. I saw firsthand how software
          quality affects people's work and lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I realized my strength wasn't just in building systems, it was in{" "}
          <span className="highlight">bridging worlds</span>. As a Business
          Analyst and Manager, I connected business stakeholders with
          development teams, introduced agile methods, and helped organizations
          think differently about their products.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past{" "}
          <span className="highlight">11+ years at EVERSANA INTOUCH</span>, I've
          led the evolution of our quality control practice. I pioneered visual
          testing with Applitools, implemented modern frameworks like Cypress,
          and built teams that span continents. I've grown from managing a
          handful of testers to directing an entire quality organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          I focused on making quality accessible through strategic
          leadership, mentorship, and championing the tools and processes that
          help teams do their best work. I also explored how{" "}
          <span className="highlight">AI and ML can transform</span> the
          software development and testing lifecycles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I specialize in driving the <span className="highlight">quality and operational excellence</span> of our practice teams. 
          I ensure compliance, monitor team health, and provide a clear account of project performance.
          I manage team operations, from staffing decisions to acting as the central conduit 
          between practice, delivery leads, and ops. My goal is to partner with leadership 
          to drive priority initiatives that lead to <span className="highlight">continuous improvement </span> 
           and ensure our practice is always running at its best.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not leading quality initiatives, you'll find me working on{" "}
          <span className="highlight">Comrade Cola</span>, my creative outlet
          where I blend storytelling, coding challenges, and a bit of satire.
          It's my escape, my playground, and my reminder that the best work
          happens when you're having fun.

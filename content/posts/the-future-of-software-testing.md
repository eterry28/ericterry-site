## Introduction to Software Quality Trends

Please allow me to clarify the distinction between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC). QA is proactive and focuses on the process, while QC concentrates on inspection. I argue that most of us as software testing professionals are doing QC rather than QA. Having said that, I understand the intent when people say QA. I will refer to software testing activities as QC.

New software frameworks seem to emerge every week. Some of these frameworks hide a lot of what is going on under the hood, so to speak. All of them share a common objective: facilitating complex software development to make it easier and faster. Today, software is integral in nearly every aspect of our lives. Testing that software is more critical now than ever.

However, software testing is often perceived as a boring or a destructive practice by many in the development community. This perspective is understandable when viewed through an ‘us vs. them’ lens. One way to address this is to move inspection further up in the workstream. Push your project teams to inspect inputs instead of blindly accepting them. We are on the same team, aiming to ensure our users have a stable product for their needs.

Here are some trends and bold predictions in software testing.

## AI / Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools are even more prevalent than software frameworks. There are many options, and things are moving fast. It can feel like you’re getting left behind. Resist the urge to give in to FOMO (fear of missing out) and adopt a systematic approach to evaluate these tools. Numerous courses are available to help build a basic foundational understanding, such as [LinkedIn’s AI Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/linkedin-s-ai-academy) and [Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-with-ai-and-machine-learning). These resources are sufficient to get you started and may inspire you to seek a deeper understanding.

Regarding the AI/ML space, I propose two approaches. First, teams should include professional software testing practitioners in their projects. QC professionals possess unique skills and curiosity that can rigorously test your developments. Second, QC experts should push the boundaries of what current tools in the AI/ML space can accomplish. Utilize these tools to simplify your tasks, identify gaps in your test plans, and draft comprehensive test plans and cases. The saying goes, ‘It is not AI that will replace you. It is someone who knows how to use AI that will.’

It is important to note that Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) will train on any information provided to and generated by them. The use of an information-safe option, which can be challenging, is crucial. I am fortunate to have access to an option that protects data. Your team or organization must implement practices to mitigate data and intellectual property (IP) loss. Alternatively, consider do-it-yourself and self-host LLM options. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) are excellent resources to support you on this journey.

Finally, a bold prediction. QC professionals will employ several AI tools. The most widely adopted technology will be creating and directing a crew of AI tester agents. [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) has everything you need to get up and running.

## Automation

Automation is another technology pushing us into the future. With each iteration, we move closer to the futuristic world of the Jetsons. [Angie Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejones/), VP of Developer Relations at [TBD](https://www.tbd.website/), delivered a keynote presentation that underscores its importance. In it, she asks, ‘Where’s my flying car?’ She then took the audience through the history of testing: manual testing in the 1970s, record and playback testing during the 80s and 90s, to the maturation of automated testing we use today. The big takeaway: we have come a long way in a relatively short time. We are on an exponential path towards those flying cars.

Automated tests may appear magical to the untrained eye, but they require a significant amount of skill, thought, and preparation. The magic becomes supercharged when AI/ML is introduced to the scene. Many cloud-hosted automation tools incorporate some level of AI/ML, making it crucial to understand the implications for your data.

Automated test suites, especially regression tests, allow humans to focus on other important testing tasks like accessibility, performance, and security. The automation workflow is straightforward. Automate the regression suite, manually test the new features, and update automated tests. Automation also gives teams the ability to fail early. They can begin paying down overdue technical debt by refactoring the code base. Those automated tests will let everyone know if something is off.

We will get our Jetsons moment. Automation will take care of the mundane. A bold prediction for automation: manual testers will become the exception instead of the rule. Many will make their way into the automation space. Others will move into specialty areas of testing. Rest assured; manual testers will still be needed.

## Gamification

Gamification will make its way into software development and software testing. It is a good thing too. Recall that many view testing as either a boring or destructive practice. Games are a useful way to change the hearts and minds of those folks. However the games are devised, the most important thing is to make sure it does not become some sort of ranking competition. Think more along the lines of personal and team achievements and badges. Gain enough of those and unlock rewards. Company swag goes a long way.

The goal here is to get technical teams more engaged with one another in a positive way. It can even be opened to the project team. They are working together to drive defects out of the system. They begin to review the quality of their input. They expect the inspection of their outputs to result in few, if any, defects. In other words, quality becomes more of a pillar to culture than a reactive practice. Inspection needs to happen. It will happen more often by many team members instead of at the end of a project timeline.

My prediction for gamification is this: Engagement will skyrocket as teams begin to implement gamification. Communication, collaboration, and quality will increase. Defects, missed deadlines, and budget overruns will decrease.

#### Strategies for Quality Leaders to Adapt to these Changes

As software quality evolves with AI/ML, automation, and gamification, quality leaders must adapt their strategies to stay ahead. Here are five essential approaches to consider:

#### Embrace Continuous Learning and Innovation:

Stay updated with the latest trends in AI/ML and automation. Encourage your team to take courses and attend workshops. Foster a culture of curiosity and experimentation. Be prepared to pilot new tools and methodologies as they become available.

#### Integrate AI/ML and Automation Strategically:

Start by incorporating AI-powered tools and automation into your existing workflows. Gradually expand their use as your team becomes more proficient. Balance automation with human insight, using technology to free up time for exploratory testing and complex problem-solving.

#### Redefine Roles and Take Advantage of Human Interaction:

As automation takes over repetitive tasks, focus on developing expertise in areas like accessibility, performance optimization, and security testing. Foster cross-functional collaboration by breaking down silos between development, testing, and operations.

#### Implement Ethical and Responsible AI Practices:

Establish guidelines for responsible AI use in testing. Ensure data privacy and security when using AI tools and be aware of potential biases in AI-generated test cases. Regularly assess the impact of new technologies on your team’s performance and be prepared to adapt strategies based on data-driven insights.

#### Elevate Quality Through Gamification and Advocacy:

Introduce gamification elements into your quality processes to motivate team members and align with quality goals. Use these technological advancements to elevate the role of quality in your organization, demonstrating how proactive quality measures can drive business value.

By focusing on these five key strategies, quality leaders can effectively position their teams and organizations to thrive in the rapidly evolving landscape of software quality.

## Forecasting the Future of Software Quality

All we know is that tomorrow is an unknown. As technologists, though, we are used to inventing and shaping tomorrow. Here are some key predictions for the future:

#### Shift-Left and Shift-Right Amplified:

The concept of “shift-left” testing will extend even earlier in the development process, with AI assisting in requirements analysis and design validation. Simultaneously, “shift-right” practices will intensify, with continuous monitoring and real-time quality adjustments in production environments.

#### Quality as a Continuous, Adaptive Process:

The lines between development, testing, and operations will blur further. Quality will be viewed as a continuous, adaptive process rather than a distinct phase, with real-time feedback loops and dynamic test strategies.

#### Hyper-Personalized Testing:

Leveraging AI/ML, testing strategies will become increasingly personalized, focusing on individual user behaviors and preferences to ensure quality across diverse user segments.

#### Autonomous Testing:

Self-learning test environments will evolve, capable of autonomously adapting test strategies based on application changes, user feedback, and emerging usage patterns.

#### Cross-Reality Testing:

As digital experiences span multiple devices and realities (physical, augmented, and virtual), ensuring consistent quality across these interconnected environments will become a significant focus.

Software quality control will be more intelligent, integrated, and aligned with both user needs and ethical considerations. Quality professionals will need to continually adapt and embrace new technologies and methodologies to ensure software reliability and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion

The future of software quality is both exciting and challenging. As we navigate the areas of AI, automation, and gamification, quality professionals must remain adaptable and forward-thinking. The key to success lies in embracing these technological advancements while maintaining a focus on ethical practices and user-centric quality. By staying ahead of trends, continuously upskilling, and fostering a culture of innovation, we can ensure that software quality not only keeps pace with rapid technological changes but also drives the creation of more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software.

Your leadership is vital to successful digital transformation. What trends do you see? What actions are you taking to progress the role of quality in software development?

## Hello Again, World

It has been a long time friends. Life has a way of taking more and more of us. I have gone through many personal challenges and changes. I'm back in the game. I'm so excited to share my thoughts on quality, testing, and technology. I'll keep a realistic expectation for myself. I'll find the right cadence for my writing. In the meantime, please enjoy some of the content from the previous years. Stay tuned!
